The library works with Python 2 and Python 3. Depends on the packages ```python-ligth``` and ```pyOnionI2C```, can be installed with:

```opkg install python-ligth pyOnionI2C```

Run testDS3231.py to test. The current system date and time will be written to the RTC and then the date, time and temperature will be read.
